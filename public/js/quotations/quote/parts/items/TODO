* Fix initial item that on modal, the discount and unit Price doesnt appear
* When you click "Adicionar produtos" for the first time it seems like it loads twice
* Icons should only live inside viewgen and not items-render.js
* I think there's so much logic that shoul've been inside math.js instead and not all inside render
